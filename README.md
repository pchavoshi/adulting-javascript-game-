This game is inspired by the Lilo & Stitch Sandwich Stacker, where a small alien moves back and forth on a screen to catch different sandwich ingredients as they fall, avoiding rotten ingredients, stacking up points with the biggest and best sandwich. This game will involve similar gameplay but the concept revolves around adult responsibilities - how many can you catch? How many screwups can you avoid?
