# adulting-javascript-game-

This game is inspired by the Lilo & Stitch Sandwich Stacker, where a small alien moves back and forth on a screen to catch different sandwich ingredients as they fall, avoiding rotten ingredients, stacking up points with the biggest and best sandwich. This game will involve similar gameplay but the concept revolves around adult responsibilities - how many can you catch? How many screwups can you avoid? 

## MVP

Minimum gameplay requires users to be able to move a character onscreen back and forth as well as different objects to fall towards the player at varying speeds. 

The game will also feature a modal with game rules and directions. 

## Technologies and Anticipated Challenges 

*JavaScript will handle game logic 

*Webpack will bundle js files 

Gameplay will be written into two scripts: 

*gameplay.js - Handles all game logic behind the scenes, including object falling, avatar movement, and catching objects. 
*game.js - Compact file housing constructors and updategame 

Given the simple nature of game play I anticipate one of my bigger challenges to be sourcing appropriate images. 

## Implementation Timeline 

### Day 1 - 

Write a basic entry file and skeletons for script files, get Webpack packing, and begin breaking down gameplay logic. Achieve character movement. 

### Day 2 - 

Implement falling objects with varying speeds and code for collisions (catching) objects with user 

### Day 3 - 

Create levels of varying intensity. Add a directions modal. Style background. 

### Day 4 -

Style game and add attractive images for falling objects and user character. 

## Aspirational Features 

*Running User Scoreboard 

*Leaderboard
